# UFC Fighter Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes UFC fighter performance data to explore relationships between grappling success and striking accuracy. Using exploratory data analysis, visualization, hypothesis testing, and linear regression, the project evaluates whether takedown success is a meaningful predictor of significant strike accuracy.

## Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (Tableau & Python)
- Hypothesis testing using scatterplots and trend analysis
- Linear regression modeling in Python
- Model evaluation using R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Key Findings
- A slight positive relationship exists between takedown success and significant strike accuracy.
- The relationship is very weak (R² ≈ 0.02–0.03).
- Takedown success alone explains less than 3% of the variation in striking accuracy.
- Fighter performance appears multifactorial and cannot be explained by a single metric.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a data analytics portfolio assignment. Some datasets may be excluded due to course data-sharing policies.
